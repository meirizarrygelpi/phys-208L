%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this experiment you will learn about electric charge and how it can be transferred between bodies.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Electric charge is another \textbf{fundamental} property of matter. It can take \textbf{positive, negative, or zero} values. It can be transferred between objects via \textbf{contact}. In some kinds of matter, electric charge can be removed via \textbf{friction}.

The \textbf{SI unit} for electric charge is the coulomb (C). One coulomb worth of electric charge is a very large amount of charged particles. The electric charge of a single proton is
\begin{equation}
	\text{electric charge of proton} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
	1 \text{ C} = 1 \text{ C} \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ proton}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}\right) = 6.242 \times 10^{18} \text{ protons}
\end{equation}
In this experiment, you are going to measure electric charge in nanocoulombs (nC). One nanocoulomb is equivalent to $10^{-9}$ C:
\begin{equation}
	1 \text{ nC} = 1 \text{ nC} \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ proton}}{1.602 \times 10^{-10} \text{ nC}}\right) = 6.242 \times 10^{9} \text{ protons}
\end{equation}
That is, one nanocoulomb is equivalent to more than six billion protons.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Experiment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are three experiments: one to test the \textbf{effect of friction}, one to test the \textbf{transfer of electric charge via contact}, and one to test the \textbf{effect of grounding}. In each experiment you used different kinds of probes. There were three kinds of probe, made of different materials: \textbf{white}, \textbf{gray}, and \textbf{metal}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 1: Grounding strap}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 1 consisted of testing the effect of not wearing the grounding strap. You should have recorded your observations.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 2: Effect of friction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 2 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{friction}. You did \textbf{four runs} here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run 1: White probe in/out; Gray probe in/out; Both probes in/out
	\item Run 2: White probe in/out; Gray probe in/out; Both probes in/out (repeat of run 1)
	\item Run 3: White probe in/out; Metal probe in/out; Both probes in/out
	\item Run 4: Gray probe in/out; Metal probe in/out; Both probes in/out
\end{itemize}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 3: Transfer via contact}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 3 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{contact}. You did two runs here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run 5: White probe in/out; White probe contact; White probe out
	\item Run 6: Gray probe in/out; Gray probe contact; Gray probe out
\end{itemize}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 4: Effect of grounding}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 4 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{grounding}. You did two runs here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run 7: White probe in/out; White probe in; Ground the pail; White probe out
	\item Run 8: Gray probe in/out; Gray probe in; Ground the pail; Gray probe out
\end{itemize}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For each of the eight runs, you used the Faraday pail to measure electric charge over time. In order to determine the value measure, you can do an average over the region corresponding to each different measurement. Use the \texttt{AVERAGE} function.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Questions for Part 1: Grounding strap}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here are some questions for part 1.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item While \textbf{not using} the grounding strap, and \textbf{before} scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While \textbf{not using} the grounding strap, and \textbf{after} scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While \textbf{using} the grounding strap, and \textbf{before} scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While \textbf{using} the grounding strap, and \textbf{after} scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item Explain the function of the grounding strap.
\end{enumerate}
The answers to these questions are qualitative: Does the charge change? Or does the charge stay the same?
