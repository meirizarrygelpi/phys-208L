\section{Preliminary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Electric charge is another fundamental property of matter. It can take positive, negative, or zero values. It can be transferred between objects via contact. In some kinds of matter, electric charge can be removed via friction.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Experiment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are three experiments: one to test the \textbf{effect of friction}, one to test the \textbf{transfer of electric charge via contact}, and one to test the \textbf{effect of grounding}. In each experiment you used different kinds of probes. There were three kinds of probe, made of different materials: \textbf{white}, \textbf{gray}, and \textbf{metal}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 1 consisted of testing the effect of not wearing the grounding strap.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 2 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{friction}. You did \textbf{four runs} here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run 1: White probe in/out; Gray probe in/out; Both probes in/out
	\item Run 2: White probe in/out; Gray probe in/out; Both probes in/out (repeat of run 1)
	\item Run 3: White probe in/out; Metal probe in/out; Both probes in/out
	\item Run 4: Gray probe in/out; Metal probe in/out; Both probes in/out
\end{enumerate}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 3 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{contact}. You did two runs here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run 5: White probe in/out; White probe contact; White probe out
	\item Run 6: Gray probe in/out; Gray probe contact; Gray probe out
\end{enumerate}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Part 4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part 4 was meant to study the effect of \textbf{grounding}. You did two runs here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run 7: White probe in/out; White probe in; Ground the pail; White probe out
	\item Run 8: Gray probe in/out; Gray probe in; Ground the pail; Gray probe out
\end{enumerate}
For each run you recorded the electric charge on the Faraday pail as it changed over time.

\subsection{Questions for Part 1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here are some questions for part 1.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item While not using the grounding strap, and before scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While not using the grounding strap, and after scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While using the grounding strap, and before scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item While using the grounding strap, and after scuffing his shoes, what happens to the charge reading when the instructor's finger is brought inside the Faraday pail?
	\item Explain the function of the grounding strap.
\end{enumerate}
The answers to these questions are qualitative: Does the charge change? Or does the charge stay the same?
